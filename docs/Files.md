 What is YAML?
YAML stands for "YAML Ainâ€™t Markup Language" â€” itâ€™s a human-readable data serialization format. It's often used for configuration files and data exchange between languages with different data structures.

Think of it as a cleaner, more readable alternative to XML or JSON.

ðŸ“˜ Basic YAML Syntax
Here's an example YAML file:

``` yaml
name: Jane Doe
age: 25
is_student: true
skills:
  - Python
  - JavaScript
  - YAML
address:
  street: 123 Main St
  city: Metropolis
  zip: 12345
```

  : is used for key-value pairs

- indicates a list item

Nested structures use indentation (with spaces)
