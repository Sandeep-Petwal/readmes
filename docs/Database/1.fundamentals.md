## What is Data?

- **Data** is raw, unprocessed facts, figures, or symbols. It can be numbers, text, images, audio, or video.
- Data by itself has no meaning until it is processed or interpreted.

**Examples:**
- 42, "John", 3.14, "2024-05-01"

## What is Information?

- **Information** is processed, organized, or structured data that is meaningful and useful for decision-making.
- Information = Data + Context + Meaning

**Example:**
- Data: 42, "John"
- Information: "John is 42 years old."

## What is a Database?

- A **database** is an organized collection of related data, stored and accessed electronically.
- Databases allow efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data.
- Can be as simple as a text file or as complex as a distributed cloud system.

**Key Features:**
- Persistent storage
- Structured organization
- Efficient querying and updating

## Database Management System (DBMS)

- A **DBMS** is software that manages databases, providing tools for data definition, manipulation, security, and integrity.
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle, SQL Server

**Core Functions:**
- Data storage, retrieval, and update
- Transaction management
- Concurrency control
- Security and access control
- Backup and recovery

## Types of Databases

1. **Relational Databases (RDBMS):** Data is stored in tables (relations) with rows and columns. Uses SQL for queries.
2. **Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases:** Flexible schema, designed for scalability and specific use cases (document, key-value, graph, columnar).
3. **Other Types:** Hierarchical, Network, Object-Oriented, Time-Series, NewSQL, etc.

## Relational Databases

- Based on the relational model (E.F. Codd, 1970).
- Data is organized into tables (relations).
- Each table has rows (records) and columns (fields/attributes).
- Tables can be related via keys (primary, foreign).
- Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for data manipulation.

**Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite

**Key Concepts:**
- **Primary Key:** Unique identifier for a row.
- **Foreign Key:** Reference to a primary key in another table.
- **Schema:** Structure of tables, columns, and relationships.

## Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases

- Designed for flexibility, scalability, and handling unstructured or semi-structured data.
- No fixed schema; data can be nested or hierarchical.
- Four main types:
  1. **Document Stores:** JSON-like documents (MongoDB, CouchDB)
  2. **Key-Value Stores:** Simple key-value pairs (Redis, DynamoDB)
  3. **Column-Family Stores:** Columns grouped into families (Cassandra, HBase)
  4. **Graph Databases:** Nodes and edges for relationships (Neo4j, ArangoDB)

**Use Cases:**
- Big data, real-time analytics, content management, IoT, social networks

## Relational vs Non-Relational Databases

| Feature                | Relational (RDBMS)         | Non-Relational (NoSQL)         |
|------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Schema                 | Fixed, predefined          | Dynamic, flexible              |
| Data Structure         | Tables (rows/columns)      | Documents, key-value, graph    |
| Query Language         | SQL                        | Varies (JSON, API, etc.)       |
| Transactions           | Strong ACID support        | Varies (often BASE)            |
| Scalability            | Vertical (scale-up)        | Horizontal (scale-out)         |
| Relationships          | Strong, via foreign keys   | Weak or application-level      |
| Examples               | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle  | MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra      |

## Database Design Principles

- **Data Modeling:** Identify entities, attributes, and relationships.
- **ER Diagrams:** Visualize tables and relationships.
- **Normalization:** Organize data to reduce redundancy.
- **Denormalization:** Optimize for read performance by introducing redundancy.
- **Indexing:** Speed up queries on large datasets.
- **Constraints:** Enforce data integrity (unique, not null, foreign key).

## Normalization & Denormalization

- **Normalization:**
  - Process of organizing data to minimize redundancy.
  - Normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, etc.)
  - Each table should have a primary key.
- **Denormalization:**
  - Introducing redundancy for performance (faster reads, fewer joins).
  - Used in analytics, reporting, NoSQL systems.

## Transactions & ACID Properties

- **Transaction:** A sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit.
- **ACID:**
  - **Atomicity:** All or nothing
  - **Consistency:** Valid state transitions
  - **Isolation:** Concurrent transactions don't interfere
  - **Durability:** Once committed, changes persist
- **BASE (NoSQL):**
  - **Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent**

## Indexes & Query Optimization

- **Index:** Data structure to speed up data retrieval (B-tree, hash, etc.)
- **Query Optimization:** DBMS chooses the most efficient way to execute a query (query planner, execution plan).
- **Best Practices:**
  - Index columns used in WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY
  - Avoid over-indexing (write penalty)
  - Analyze slow queries

## Backup, Recovery & Security

- **Backup:** Regularly save database state (full, incremental, differential)
- **Recovery:** Restore data after failure
- **Security:**
  - Authentication & authorization
  - Encryption (at rest, in transit)
  - Auditing & monitoring
  - Principle of least privilege
