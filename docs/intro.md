## My Learning Philosophy

I believe in learning by doing and documenting as I go. These notes are created while I'm actively working with these technologies, so they include real-world examples and common pitfalls I've encountered.

Whether you're learning alongside me or just browsing for reference, I hope you find something useful here!
