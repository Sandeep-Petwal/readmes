## Network Performance and QoS

### Bandwidth and Throughput
```performance
# Bandwidth vs Throughput
Bandwidth: Maximum data transfer rate (theoretical)
Throughput: Actual data transfer rate (measured)

# Common Bandwidth Units
1 Mbps = 1,000,000 bits per second
1 Gbps = 1,000,000,000 bits per second
1 Tbps = 1,000,000,000,000 bits per second

# Throughput Calculation
Throughput = (Data Size) / (Transfer Time)
Effective Throughput = (Data Size) / (Total Time including overhead)
```

### Latency and Jitter
```latency
# Latency Types
Propagation Delay: Time for signal to travel through medium
Transmission Delay: Time to push all bits onto the link
Processing Delay: Time for routers to process packet
Queuing Delay: Time waiting in router buffers

# Latency Measurement
ping www.google.com
traceroute www.google.com
mtr www.google.com
```

### Quality of Service (QoS)
```qos
# QoS Mechanisms
Traffic Classification: Identify different types of traffic
Traffic Marking: Set priority levels (DSCP, CoS)
Traffic Policing: Limit traffic rate
Traffic Shaping: Smooth traffic bursts
Queuing: Priority-based packet scheduling

# QoS Priority Levels
Voice: Highest priority (VoIP)
Video: High priority (streaming)
Data: Medium priority (web browsing)
Background: Low priority (file downloads)
