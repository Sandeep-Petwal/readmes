## What is ngrok?

ngrok is a tool that creates secure tunnels from the public internet to your local machine. It is widely used for testing webhooks, sharing local sites, and remote debugging.

- Expose local servers behind NATs and firewalls
- Test webhooks from third-party services (Stripe, GitHub, etc.)
- Share local development sites with teammates or clients

## Installation

### macOS
```bash
brew install --cask ngrok
```

### Windows
```powershell
choco install ngrok
```

### Linux
```bash
sudo snap install ngrok
```

Or download from [ngrok.com/download](https://ngrok.com/download)

## Basic Usage

Start a tunnel to your local server (e.g., running on port 3000):

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

You will get a public URL (https and http) that forwards to your local port.

## Common Use Cases

- **Webhook Testing:**
  - Use the public URL in services like Stripe, GitHub, or Twilio to receive webhooks on your local machine.
- **Sharing Local Sites:**
  - Share the ngrok URL with others to demo your app.
- **Mobile App Development:**
  - Test mobile apps against a backend running on your laptop.

## Authentication & Dashboard

Sign up at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) for a free account to get an authtoken. This unlocks more features and higher limits.

```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken <your-token>
```

Access the web dashboard at [http://localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040) to inspect requests and responses in real time.

## Advanced Features

- **Custom Subdomains:**
  - Paid plans allow you to reserve subdomains: `ngrok http -subdomain=myapp 3000`
- **TCP/UDP Tunnels:**
  - Expose other protocols: `ngrok tcp 22` (for SSH)
- **Request Inspection:**
  - Inspect, replay, and modify HTTP requests via the dashboard.
- **Access Control:**
  - Restrict tunnel access with basic auth: `ngrok http -auth="user:pass" 3000`

## Security Considerations

- Do not expose sensitive or production services without proper authentication.
- Tunnels are public; anyone with the URL can access your local server.
- Use ngrok's access control and IP restrictions for sensitive endpoints.

## Troubleshooting

- **Tunnel Not Working:**
  - Check your local server is running and accessible.
  - Ensure firewall allows incoming connections.
- **Port Already in Use:**
  - Use a different port or stop the conflicting service.
- **ngrok Limits:**
  - Free plan has connection and session limits. Upgrade for more.
