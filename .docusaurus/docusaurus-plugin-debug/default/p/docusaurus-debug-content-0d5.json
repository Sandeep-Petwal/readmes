I was losing valuable knowledge because I wasn't documenting my learning process properly.\r\n\r\n## The Solution: Learning in Public\r\n\r\nI decided to create this website as my **personal knowledge base** - a place where I can:\r\n\r\n- 📝 **Document everything I learn** with real examples\r\n- 🔄 **Refer back easily** when I need to implement something again\r\n- 🚀 **Share with others** who might be on similar learning paths\r\n- 📈 **Track my progress** and see how far I've come\r\n\r\n## What You'll Find Here\r\n\r\nThis site is organized into two main areas:\r\n\r\n### 🎯 Frontend Technologies\r\nFrom React basics to advanced concepts like Redux Toolkit, Socket.io client integration, and modern UI libraries. Each guide includes:\r\n- Setup instructions\r\n- Real code examples\r\n- Common pitfalls I encountered\r\n- Best practices I discovered\r\n\r\n### ⚙️ Backend Technologies\r\nServer-side development, authentication systems, real-time communication, and security implementations. Everything I learn about building robust backend services.\r\n\r\n## My Learning Philosophy\r\n\r\nI believe in **learning by doing** and **documenting as I go**. These aren't just tutorials - they're my actual notes from building real projects. You'll find:\r\n\r\n- ✅ Working code examples\r\n- ❌ Mistakes I made and how I fixed them\r\n- 💡 Tips and tricks I discovered\r\n- 🔧 Practical implementations\r\n\r\n## Why This Matters\r\n\r\nCreating this site has already helped me in several ways:\r\n\r\n1. **Better Retention** - Writing about what I learn helps me remember it better\r\n2. **Faster Development** - I can quickly reference my own guides instead of searching the web\r\n3. **Community Building** - Sharing knowledge helps others and creates connections\r\n4. **Portfolio** - This site itself is a testament to my learning journey\r\n\r\n## Join Me on This Journey\r\n\r\nWhether you're:\r\n- Learning the same technologies\r\n- Looking for practical examples\r\n- Just curious about my approach\r\n- Building your own knowledge base\r\n\r\nYou're welcome here! Feel free to explore, learn, and even reach out if you have questions or suggestions.\r\n\r\n## What's Next?\r\n\r\nI'll be continuously adding new content as I learn:\r\n- New frameworks and libraries\r\n- Advanced concepts in existing technologies\r\n- Project case studies\r\n- Lessons learned from real-world applications\r\n\r\nThis website is a living document of my growth as a developer. I hope it helps you on your own learning journey!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Happy coding! 🚀*\r\n\r\n*P.S. If you're also building a knowledge base or learning in public, I'd love to hear about your approach!*"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/Sandeep-Petwal/readmes/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-26-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Docusaurus blogging features are powered by the blog plugin.","date":"2021-08-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Facebook","permalink":"/blog/tags/facebook","description":"Facebook tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"Hello","permalink":"/blog/tags/hello","description":"Hello tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"Docusaurus","permalink":"/blog/tags/docusaurus","description":"Docusaurus tag description"}],"readingTime":0.56,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Sandeep Prasad","title":"Full Stack Developer & Tech Enthusiast","url":"https://sandeepprasad.xyz","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/sandeep"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/Sandeep-Petwal","website":"https://sandeepprasad.xyz"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/Sandeep-Petwal.png","key":"sandeep"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome","authors":["sandeep"],"tags":["facebook","hello","docusaurus"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Why I Created This Website -
